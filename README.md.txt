============================
Purpose of this app is so I 
can learn Python and some 
frameworks (Flask, React, Node). 
This website will use Riot's
API to supply data to the app
about Legends of Runeterra. 
Possibly include db too for more
logic.


Rough idea on what the website will have:

	* Home (idk what is going here)
	  |______ something from reddit?
	  |______ latest news/patch?
  	  |______ HQ pictures/promos?
	* Master's leaderboard (Top players)
	  |______ leaderboard of players
	* Deckbuilder
	  |______ Implement deck restrictions
	  |______ Menu to select which region(s) to show (max 2)
	  |______ possible filter system for spells, champs, 5 mana etc...
	  |______ way to create the deck code string
	* Card gallery (?)
	  |______ show all cards
		 |_______ picture
		 |_______ name
		 |_______ description
		 |_______ stats
		 |_______ type
	  |______ filter/sort system
	* Decks submitted (?)
	  |______ decks
		 |_______ submitted by
		 |_______ when
		 |_______ popularity? wr?
		 |_______ deck snapshot
	* Card statistics (is this possible?)
	  |______ table with tabs
		 |_______ mulligan wr
		 |_______ drawn wr
		 |_______ wr vs popularity
	  |______ sort/filter system
	* About
	  |______ why i made this
